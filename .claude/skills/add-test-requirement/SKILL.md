  Add a test requirement to the ***test reqs*** section of a ***plain spec
  file. Use when the user wants to specify conformance testing instructions
  like test frameworks, execution methods, or testing constraints in a .plain
  file.

# Add Test Requirement

Always use the skill `load-plain-reference` to retrieve the ***plain syntax rules — but only if you haven't done so yet.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the target `.plain` file.** If ambiguous, ask the user.
2. **Read the file** to understand existing test reqs and the overall spec structure.
3. **Confirm this is a conformance test concern** — unit test guidance goes in `***implementation reqs***`, not here.
4. **Draft the requirement** following the rules below.
5. **Insert it** into the `***test reqs***` section.
6. **Read the file again** to confirm correct placement and syntax.

## What Belongs Here

Test reqs specify how **conformance tests** should be written and run. Common contents:

- **Test framework**: which framework to use (e.g., pytest, Unittest, xUnit)
- **Execution method**: the command to run the tests
- **Testing constraints**: what must or must not be done in tests (e.g., no skipping tests, mock requirements)
- **Test data**: how test fixtures or mock data should be structured
- **Environment setup**: any prerequisites for running conformance tests

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- **Unit test guidance** — that goes in `***implementation reqs***`
- **Acceptance tests** — those are nested under individual functional specs in `***functional specs***`
- **Behavioral requirements** — those go in `***functional specs***`
- **Technology choices for the implementation** — those go in `***implementation reqs***`

## Conformance Tests vs Other Tests

| Test Type | Where to Specify | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Unit tests | `***implementation reqs***` | Test individual functionalities in isolation |
| Conformance tests | `***test reqs***` | Verify implementation conforms to the full spec |
| Acceptance tests | `***acceptance tests***` under a functional spec | Verify a specific functional spec |

## Format

Test reqs are bullet points in the `***test reqs***` section:

```plain
***test reqs***
- :ConformanceTests: should be implemented using pytest framework.
- :ConformanceTests: will be run using "pytest" command.
- :ConformanceTests: must be implemented and executed - do not skip tests.
- :ConformanceTests: should mock all external HTTP calls.
```

Reference predefined concepts like `:ConformanceTests:` and any defined `:Concepts:` where they add clarity.

## Line syntax (hard rule)

**Every line inside `***test reqs***` must be its own list item starting with `- `.** ***plain has no concept of bare continuation lines — indented prose without a leading `- ` is **invalid syntax** and the renderer will reject it.

- Hard limit: 120 characters per line. If a sentence is too long, **split it at a natural clause boundary into nested `- ` bullets** — never wrap onto an unprefixed line.
- Nested clarifications are also `- ` items, indented under the parent. The indentation alone is not enough; the leading `- ` is required.

BAD — bare continuation lines (invalid ***plain syntax, will not render):

```plain
- :ConformanceTests: must mock all external HTTP calls so that the
  test suite remains hermetic and does not depend on network access.
```

GOOD — every line starts with `- `:

```plain
- :ConformanceTests: must mock all external HTTP calls.
  - The test suite must remain hermetic.
  - Tests must not depend on network access.
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Describes conformance testing concerns, not unit tests or behavior
- [ ] All referenced `:Concepts:` are defined (or are predefined like `:ConformanceTests:`)
- [ ] Does not duplicate guidance already present in the file or its imports
- [ ] Placed inside a `***test reqs***` section
- [ ] No behavioral requirements that should be in `***functional specs***`
