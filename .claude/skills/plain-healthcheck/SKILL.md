  Verification gate for a ***plain project. Verifies that every `config.yaml`
  exists, points at scripts that actually live in `test_scripts/`, and that
  `codeplain <top_module>.plain --dry-run` passes for every top module in
  the project. Run this whenever anything in the project is finalized —
  including (but not limited to) the end of `forge-plain`, the end of
  `add-feature`, after `debug-specs`, after any single-skill edit that
  finalizes a concept, functional spec, requirement, template, or config —
  and any time the user asks "is the project ready to render?".

# Plain Healthcheck

Always use the skill `load-plain-reference` to retrieve the ***plain syntax rules — but only if you haven't done so yet.

## When to run

Run this skill **whenever anything in the ***plain project is finalized** and the project is about to be left in a state the user (or another skill) might render from. That includes, but is not limited to:

- **End of `forge-plain`** (Phase 4) — before presenting the render command.
- **End of `add-feature`** (Phase 3 final review) — before declaring the feature done.
- **End of `debug-specs`** — after applying a fix, before telling the user to re-render.
- **After finalizing any single edit** that changes the renderable surface — e.g. after `add-concept`, `add-functional-spec`, `add-functional-specs`, `add-implementation-requirement`, `add-test-requirement`, `add-acceptance-test`, `add-template`, `add-resource`, `resolve-spec-conflict`, `break-down-func-spec`, `consolidate-concepts`, `refactor-module`, `create-import-module`, `create-requires-module`, or any of the `implement-*-testing-script` skills.
- **After hand-editing** a `.plain` file, a `config.yaml`, or anything under `test_scripts/`.
- **On demand** — whenever the user asks whether the project is in a renderable state.

The healthcheck is **not** a forge-plain-only step. Treat it as the default closing move for any workflow that finalizes something in the project.

Do **not** skip this skill because "the dry-run passed earlier" — `config.yaml`s, scripts, and specs can all drift between runs. The healthcheck is cheap; rendering against stale specs is expensive.

## Workflow

The skill is a **detect → fix → re-run** loop. It does not stop at the first failure; it surfaces everything wrong, fixes what it can, and only returns when either everything passes or a gap genuinely requires user input.

### Step 1 — Inventory the project

1. List every `.plain` file in the repo root (and any subdirectories that contain `.plain` files). Build the module graph from each file's YAML frontmatter (`requires`, `import`).
2. Identify **top modules** — every module that is not `requires`-ed by any other module. A single-stack project has one top module; a multi-part project (e.g. backend + frontend) has one top module per part.
3. List every `config.yaml` in the repo (root and per-part directories such as `backend/`, `frontend/`).
4. List every script under `test_scripts/`.
5. Pair each top module with the `config.yaml` that governs it. The pairing rule is: the config file in the same directory as the top module wins; failing that, the repo-root `config.yaml`. A multi-part project must have one config per part — record any top module that has no governing config as a failure.

Print a one-line inventory summary so the rest of the run is easy to follow, e.g. `Top modules: backend/api.plain (config: backend/config.yaml), frontend/web.plain (config: frontend/config.yaml). Scripts in test_scripts/: 4.`

### Step 2 — Validate every `config.yaml`

For each `config.yaml` in the inventory, check **all** of the following. Collect every failure — do **not** stop at the first.

1. **File parses.** It is valid YAML.
2. **At minimum `unittests-script` is present.** Every project gets a unit-test runner.
3. **For every script field that is present** (`unittests-script`, `conformance-tests-script`, `prepare-environment-script`):
   - The path is a string ending in `.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `.ps1` (Windows). The extension must match the rest of the project — do not mix `.sh` and `.ps1` in a single config.
   - The referenced file actually exists on disk under `test_scripts/`.
   - On Unix, the script has the executable bit set (`-x`). If not, that is a fixable failure.
4. **No mixed stacks per config.** Every script referenced from a single `config.yaml` must target the same language/stack. For example, `backend/config.yaml` should not reference `run_unittests_js.sh`. If a config crosses stacks, that is a failure — the project should have been split into multiple configs per the rule in `PLAIN_REFERENCE.md`.
5. **No dangling fields.** Any `*-script` field whose target file does not exist is a failure.
6. **`prepare-environment-script` implies `conformance-tests-script`.** A `prepare-environment-script` only makes sense in service of conformance tests — the environment is what those tests run against. If a `config.yaml` declares `prepare-environment-script` but does **not** declare `conformance-tests-script`, that is a failure. Surface it to the user and offer to either (a) invoke `implement-conformance-testing-script` to add the missing script, or (b) remove the `prepare-environment-script` field if it was added in error. Do not auto-pick.
7. **No orphan scripts.** Every script under `test_scripts/` should be referenced by *some* `config.yaml`. If a script is never referenced, surface it as a **warning** (not a hard failure — the user may be in the middle of authoring).

For each failure, record the offending config path, the offending field, and the concrete problem (`file missing`, `not executable`, `mixed stack`, etc.).

#### Auto-fixes you may apply

- **Missing executable bit** on a script that otherwise looks fine → `chmod +x <path>`.
- **Stale path that points at a renamed script that clearly exists under a different name in `test_scripts/`** → only if there is exactly one obvious candidate (same language tag, same script kind). When in doubt, leave it for the user.

Anything else (missing script, mixed stacks, missing `config.yaml`) must be surfaced to the user — do not silently regenerate scripts here. Re-invoking `implement-unit-testing-script`, `implement-conformance-testing-script`, or `implement-prepare-environment-script` from inside the healthcheck is allowed **only** if the user explicitly approves it after being shown the gap.

### Step 3 — Dry-run every top module

For each `(top_module, config.yaml)` pair from Step 1, run a dry-run from the project root via the `terminal` tool:

```bash
codeplain <top_module>.plain --dry-run
```

**Match the dry-run to how the user will actually render.** Pass the flags the user would pass for the real render so what you validate is what they will run:

- **`--config-name <name>`** — required whenever the governing config file is not the default `config.yaml`, or when the project has multiple `config.yaml`s and the dry-run is being launched from somewhere that isn't the part's directory. `--config-name` takes a *file name*, not a path; if needed, `cd` into the part's directory before running so the right `config.yaml` is found.
- **`--template-dir <path>`** — only when templates live outside `template/` **and** `template_dir` is not already set in the relevant config.
- **`--full-plain`** — useful when an `import`/`requires` chain is suspect.
- **`--verbose` / `-v`** — strongly recommended on a failed dry-run; the extra log output usually pinpoints the offending `.plain` file and spec.

Treat the dry-run as a hard gate: the healthcheck **only passes** when every top module's dry-run exits successfully.

#### When a dry-run fails

Iterate until it passes:

1. Read the error output. If the first run was not verbose, immediately re-run with `--verbose`. Identify the offending `.plain` file, the line (if reported), and the kind of issue: missing concept, syntax error, cyclic definition, complexity violation (`Functional spec too complex!`), conflicting reqs, missing template, broken `import`/`requires`, missing config field, etc.
2. Fix only the `.plain` files (or the relevant `config.yaml` / template) using the appropriate edit skill — `add-concept`, `add-functional-spec`, `add-functional-specs`, `add-implementation-requirement`, `resolve-spec-conflict`, `break-down-func-spec`, `consolidate-concepts`, or an inline edit. **Never** modify generated code under `plain_modules/` or `conformance_tests/`.
3. If you are uncertain about ***plain syntax for the failing construct, re-load `load-plain-reference` before fixing.
4. Re-run the same `codeplain <top_module>.plain --dry-run …` command with the same flags. Repeat until it exits successfully.

If the failure is something the healthcheck cannot reasonably fix on its own (e.g. the user has to choose between two contradictory specs and neither side was pre-approved, or a missing concept whose semantics aren't clear), **stop and surface it to the user** with the offending snippet and a concrete question. Do not invent behavior.

#### Environment failures

If `codeplain` is not on PATH, or `CODEPLAIN_API_KEY` is not set:

- Do **not** pretend the dry-run passed.
- Tell the user exactly what's missing and how to fix it (install the CLI, export the env var) and stop the healthcheck with a clearly-marked environment failure. This is the only kind of failure that may legitimately remain unresolved at the end of the skill.

### Step 4 — Report

Emit one of:

- **`PASS`** — followed by a short summary of what was checked: `N config.yaml(s) validated`, `M top module(s) dry-run`, `K scripts referenced`. The caller (`forge-plain`, `add-feature`, `debug-specs`) can then continue to its hand-off step.
- **`FAIL`** — followed by a numbered list of every unresolved problem. Each entry must include: the file (config / `.plain` / script) it applies to, the concrete issue, and what the user needs to decide if the healthcheck couldn't resolve it.

The verdict goes on the first line so callers can pattern-match without parsing the whole report.

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does **not** author new specs from scratch — use `forge-plain` / `add-feature` for that.
- It does **not** run the real render — only `--dry-run`.
- It does **not** execute the testing scripts (`run_unittests`, `run_conformance_tests`, `prepare_environment`). It only verifies that the scripts are wired up correctly via `config.yaml`. The user runs the scripts themselves.
- It does **not** silently regenerate config files or scripts. The most it does is `chmod +x` and (with user approval) re-invoke the relevant `implement-*-testing-script` skill.

## Validation Checklist
