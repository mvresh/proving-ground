# Debug Specs

Always use the skill `load-plain-reference` to retrieve the ***plain syntax rules — but only if you haven't done so yet.

## When to Use

- The user observes a bug in the running application (visual, behavioral, crash, performance).
- A conformance test or unit test is failing.
- The generated code does something unexpected or incorrect.
- The user points to a specific functional spec that seems wrong.

## Guiding Principle

Generated code in `plain_modules/` and `conformance_tests/` is **read-only** — it exists solely as evidence for diagnosis. All fixes are applied exclusively to the `.plain` spec files. The workflow is: observe → read generated code → trace to spec → fix the spec.

## Input

1. **The module name** — identifies the `plain_modules/<module_name>/` directory and the corresponding `.plain` file(s).
2. **The user's observation** — what is wrong? This can be a bug description, a screenshot, a test failure, an error message, or a general "this doesn't work right."
3. **Optional: a specific functional spec** — if the user suspects a particular spec, start there. Otherwise, investigate broadly.

## Phase 1 — Understand the Context

1. **Read the `.plain` file(s)** for the module — frontmatter, definitions, implementation reqs, test reqs, and all functional specs. Also read `import` and `requires` chains.
2. **Read the user's observation carefully.** Rephrase it back to confirm understanding. Identify:
   - What is the expected behavior?
   - What is the actual behavior?
   - Is this a visual issue, a logic issue, a crash, or a data issue?

## Phase 2 — Investigate the Generated Code

Read files in `plain_modules/<module_name>/` to understand what the renderer produced. **Do not modify any generated files.**

### 2a. Narrow the search

If the user pointed to a specific spec or area:
- Identify which generated files implement that spec's behavior.
- Read those files to understand the current implementation.

If the investigation is broad:
- Start from the entry point and follow the execution path related to the observed bug.
- Use the observation to narrow down: UI issue → look at widgets/views, logic issue → look at business logic/providers, data issue → look at models/repositories.

### 2b. Read the relevant generated code

For each relevant file:
1. Read the code and understand what it does.
2. Compare the behavior to what the spec says it should do.
3. Note any discrepancies — places where the code doesn't match the spec's intent.

### 2c. Check conformance tests and unit tests (if relevant)

If the bug manifests as a test failure:
1. Read the failing test in `conformance_tests/<module_name>/` or `plain_modules/<module_name>/test/`.
2. Understand what the test expects vs. what the implementation does.
3. Determine whether the test expectation is correct (matches the spec) or incorrect (doesn't match the spec).

## Phase 3 — Diagnose the Root Cause

Trace the issue from the generated code back to the specs. There are five possible root causes — determine which one applies **before** making changes:

| Root Cause | Symptom | Fix |
|------------|---------|-----|
| **Ambiguous spec** | The spec is correct in intent, but vague enough that the renderer interpreted it differently than intended. | Add explicit detail to the spec to eliminate the ambiguity. |
| **Missing spec** | The desired behavior is not covered by any spec. The renderer had no guidance and either did nothing or made an arbitrary choice. | Add a new functional spec using the `add-functional-spec` skill. |
| **Conflicting specs** | Two specs contradict each other, causing the renderer to produce inconsistent behavior. | Use the `resolve-spec-conflict` skill. |
| **Incorrect spec** | The spec explicitly describes the wrong behavior. The renderer implemented it faithfully, but the spec itself is wrong. | Rewrite the spec to describe the correct behavior. |
| **Missing implementation req** | The spec is correct, but the implementation req doesn't provide enough guidance for the renderer to produce the right code (e.g., missing library, missing architectural constraint, missing platform detail). | Add or update the implementation req using the `add-implementation-requirement` skill. |

### How to diagnose

1. **Read the spec that governs the buggy behavior.** Does it clearly and unambiguously describe the correct behavior?
   - If the spec is clear and correct but the code is wrong → **ambiguous spec** (the renderer misinterpreted it) or **missing implementation req**.
   - If the spec doesn't mention the behavior at all → **missing spec**.
   - If the spec explicitly describes the wrong behavior → **incorrect spec**.
2. **Check for conflicts.** Could another spec be overriding or contradicting this behavior?
   - Read all functional specs that touch the same concepts.
   - If two specs are in tension → **conflicting specs**.
3. **Check implementation reqs.** Is the renderer missing guidance on how to implement correctly?
   - Does the implementation req specify the right library, pattern, or constraint?
   - If a platform-specific or framework-specific detail is missing → **missing implementation req**.

## Phase 4 — Fix the Specs

Apply the fix based on the diagnosed root cause. Use the appropriate skill:

| Root Cause | Skill to Use |
|------------|-------------|
| Ambiguous spec | Edit the spec inline — add sub-bullets or reword for clarity |
| Missing spec | `add-functional-spec` |
| Conflicting specs | `resolve-spec-conflict` |
| Incorrect spec | Edit the spec inline — rewrite the incorrect part |
| Missing implementation req | `add-implementation-requirement` |

### Fix guidelines

- **Minimal changes.** Only modify what is necessary to fix the observed bug. Avoid rewriting unrelated specs.
- **Preserve chronological order.** If adding a new spec, place it correctly relative to existing specs.
- **Stay language-agnostic.** Functional specs describe behavior, not implementation. Platform-specific guidance belongs in implementation reqs.
- **Respect the 200 LOC limit.** If a fix makes a spec too complex, use `break-down-func-spec` to split it.
- **Check for new conflicts.** After editing, verify the fix doesn't conflict with other specs by running `analyze-func-specs` once with the edited spec(s) plus every existing spec that touches the same concepts. The batched analyzer reports all conflicting pairs in a single call; resolve each with `resolve-spec-conflict`.

## Phase 5 — Verify and Report

1. **Re-read the modified `.plain` file(s)** in full to confirm correctness.
2. **Summarize the findings** for the user:
   - What was observed (the bug)
   - What the generated code was doing (the symptom in code)
   - Which spec(s) caused the issue (the root cause)
   - What was changed in the specs (the fix)
   - What to expect after re-rendering
3. **If uncertain**, present the diagnosis and proposed fix to the user for confirmation before making changes. Some bugs have multiple possible causes — when in doubt, explain the options and let the user decide.

## Debugging Strategies

### Strategy 1: Observation-Driven (most common)

Start from the user's observation and work backward through the code to the spec.

```
User sees bug → Read generated code → Find the responsible code path →
Identify which spec governs that code → Diagnose why the spec produced wrong code →
Fix the spec
```

### Strategy 2: Spec-Focused

The user suspects a specific spec. Compare the spec directly against the generated code.

```
User points to spec → Read the spec → Find the generated code that implements it →
Compare spec intent vs. code behavior → Diagnose the gap → Fix the spec
```

### Strategy 3: Test-Failure-Driven

A test is failing. Use the test as the entry point.

```
Read failing test → Understand what it expects → Read the implementation →
Determine if the test or the implementation is wrong → Trace back to the spec →
Fix the spec (or test reqs/acceptance tests if the test itself is wrong)
```

### Strategy 4: Differential

The bug appeared after a new spec was added. Compare before and after.

```
Identify the newly added spec → Read the specs it might conflict with →
Check if the new spec introduced the bug → Use resolve-spec-conflict or
revise the new spec
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Fixing the code instead of the spec
Never modify files in `plain_modules/` or `conformance_tests/`. Even if the fix is obvious in the code, the change must be made in the `.plain` file so it persists across re-renders.

### Treating symptoms instead of root causes
If the user says "the button is in the wrong place," don't just add positioning detail. Investigate why the renderer placed it there — the root cause might be a missing layout spec, an ambiguous screen description, or a conflict with another spec.

### Over-specifying the fix
Adding too much implementation detail to a functional spec (e.g., specific pixel values, widget names, CSS properties) makes it brittle. Prefer behavior-level fixes. Use implementation reqs for platform-specific guidance.

### Ignoring ripple effects
A spec fix may affect other specs that reference the same concepts. Always check neighboring specs for conflicts after making a change.
