  Add a concept to the ***definitions*** section of a ***plain spec file. Use
  when the user wants to define a new concept, entity, or domain term in a
  .plain file.

# Add Concept

Always use the skill `load-plain-reference` to retrieve the ***plain syntax rules — but only if you haven't done so yet.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the target `.plain` file.** If ambiguous, ask the user.
2. **Read the file** to understand existing definitions, imports, and concepts.
3. **Validate the concept name** against the syntax rules below.
4. **Check for uniqueness** — the concept name must not already exist in the file or its imports.
5. **Check referenced concepts** — any `:ConceptName:` used in the definition must already be defined above it (in this file or via `import`/`requires`). Concept references must not form cycles (e.g., A references B and B references A).
6. **Check for circular references** — if the new concept references `:B:`, then `:B:` must not reference the new concept (directly or indirectly). Example of a circular definition to avoid:
   ```plain
   - :Order: is placed by :Customer: and contains :OrderItem: entries.
   - :Customer: is a user who has placed at least one :Order:.
   ```
   Fix by removing the back-reference:
   ```plain
   - :Customer: is a user of the system.
   - :Order: is placed by :Customer: and contains :OrderItem: entries.
   ```
7. **Insert the concept** into the `***definitions***` section, after any concepts it references.
8. **Read the file again** to confirm correct placement and syntax.

## Concept Syntax Rules

- Wrapped in colons: `:ConceptName:`
- CamelCase, starting with an uppercase letter
- Valid characters: letters, digits, `+`, `-`, `.`, `_`
- Must be globally unique across the spec and all its imports
- Exported concepts from `requires` modules are **not transitive** — if a concept needs to be shared across multiple `requires` modules, define it in a common import module instead

## Definition Format

A concept definition is a bullet in `***definitions***` that starts with the concept name:

```plain
***definitions***
- :ConceptName: is a description of what it represents.
```

Attributes and constraints are nested sub-bullets:

```plain
- :Task: describes an activity that needs to be done by :User:. :Task: has:
  - Name - a short description (required)
  - Notes - additional details (optional)
  - Due Date - completion deadline (optional)
```

## Line syntax (hard rule)

**Every line inside `***definitions***` must be its own list item starting with `- `.** ***plain has no concept of bare continuation lines — indented prose without a leading `- ` is **invalid syntax** and the renderer will reject it.

- Hard limit: 120 characters per line. If a sentence is too long, **split it at a natural clause boundary into nested `- ` bullets** — never wrap onto an unprefixed line.
- Nested attributes are also `- ` items, indented under the parent. The indentation alone is not enough; the leading `- ` is required.

BAD — bare continuation lines (invalid ***plain syntax, will not render):

```plain
- :Task: describes an activity that needs to be done by :User:.
  - Name is a short description that the user provides when creating
    the task and is shown in the task list.
```

GOOD — every line starts with `- `:

```plain
- :Task: describes an activity that needs to be done by :User:.
  - Name is a short description provided when creating the task.
  - The name is shown in the task list.
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Name uses `:CamelCase:` notation
- [ ] Name is globally unique (not defined elsewhere in the file or imports)
- [ ] Definition starts with the concept name
- [ ] All referenced concepts (`:OtherConcept:`) are already defined above
- [ ] No circular references between concepts
- [ ] Description is clear, concise, and language-agnostic
- [ ] Placed inside a `***definitions***` section
