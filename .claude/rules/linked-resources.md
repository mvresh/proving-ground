# Rules for linked resources in `.plain` files

Specifications can reference external files using markdown link syntax. The renderer reads the linked file's bytes verbatim and feeds them to the model alongside the spec. That mechanism only works for a specific shape of target — violating any of the rules below is one of the most common and disruptive mistakes in `.plain` authoring.

## Hard constraint: a linked resource is always a single, text-based file on disk

A linked resource **must not** be any of the following:

1. **A folder / directory.** `[integrations](src/integrations/)`, `[host project](../host_project/)` are invalid — the renderer cannot ingest a directory. Pick the single most representative file inside (a `README.md`, an exemplar source file, a manifest) and link **that**.
2. **A URL / external location.** `[Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api)`, any `http://` / `https://` / `ftp://` / `git://` / `s3://` / `gs://` target. Linked resources are local-file only. If a URL's content is essential, fetch it once, save the response to a text file under `resources/`, and link the saved file.
3. **A binary file.** PNG, JPG, GIF, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, ZIP, MP3, MP4, compiled binaries (`.exe`, `.so`, `.class`, `.wasm`), and anything else that isn't human-readable text in its raw form. Binary content cannot be meaningfully consumed by the renderer — transcribe it into a text-based form first (a UI screenshot becomes a Markdown description, a PDF spec becomes a Markdown extract or the underlying JSON Schema / OpenAPI, an architecture diagram becomes a Mermaid block).
4. **Another `.plain` file.** `[Auth Module](auth.plain)` is invalid. To reference another module, use the `require` or `import` frontmatter directives. Do not link it as a markdown resource; the `plain-dry-run` will flag this as a syntax error.


## URLs and folder paths must not appear *anywhere* in `.plain` content
- The constraint is not only about markdown links — URLs and folder paths must not appear **anywhere** in `.plain` content (concept body prose, functional-spec text, implementation reqs, test reqs)
- The renderer cannot follow URLs or open folders; a URL in prose is a *ghost dependency* — it looks meaningful to a human reader but contributes nothing to code generation, and the spec silently drifts from reality
- **The only exception** is for URLs and paths that are *values the produced software itself uses at runtime* — the base URL an integration calls, a database connection path, a CLI argument default. Those are configuration values, not external references
- Litmus test: "Would the renderer benefit from reading the bytes at this URL / folder?" If yes, save it to a file and link the file. If no (it's a runtime value the code carries forward), it can stay as plain text

## Structured protocol artifacts must be linked, never transcribed
- JSON Schema, OpenAPI / Swagger, GraphQL SDL, Protobuf `.proto`, Avro / Thrift schemas, XML XSDs, AsyncAPI specs, JSON-RPC method definitions, wire-protocol descriptions, payload examples — anything with a formal machine-readable shape — belongs in a file under `resources/` (or a subfolder of the `.plain` file's directory)
- The spec line should describe the *role* of the artifact ("the request body conforms to ...", "the public API surface is defined in ...") rather than its contents
- Reasons: one source of truth (no drift between prose and schema); the renderer and the generated code can both consume the file directly; schema changes show up cleanly as diffs

```plain
***definitions***

- :TaskCreateRequest: is the JSON payload for creating a task.
  - It is defined by [resources/task_create_request.schema.json](resources/task_create_request.schema.json).
- :TasksAPI: is the public HTTP surface for tasks.
  - It is defined by [resources/tasks_openapi.yaml](resources/tasks_openapi.yaml).

***functional specs***

- :User: should be able to add :Task: by POSTing :TaskCreateRequest: to the `POST /tasks` endpoint of :TasksAPI:.
  - The endpoint responds per :TasksAPI:.
```

## Each linked resource is referenced from exactly one place
- Linking the same file from two functional specs (or from a functional spec **and** an implementation requirement) creates two independent sources of truth — any later edit silently diverges
- If a resource needs to inform multiple parts of the project, **don't repeat the link** — attach the resource to a **concept** in `***definitions***` and reference the concept token (`:ConceptName:`) elsewhere
- If you're about to paste the same `[name](path)` link a second time, **stop** — create the concept first

```plain
***definitions***

- :TaskModalSpec: is the user-interface contract for the task modal.
  - It is fully described in [task_modal_specification.yaml](task_modal_specification.yaml).

***functional specs***

- :User: should be able to add :Task: using :TaskModalSpec:.

- :User: should be able to edit :Task: using :TaskModalSpec:.
```

## File location and path resolution
- Paths are resolved relative to the `.plain` file's directory
- The conventional location is `resources/` under the `.plain` file's directory
